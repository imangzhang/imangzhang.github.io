      <h2>What is a cat?</h2>
      <p>The cat (Felis catus) is a domestic species of small carnivorous mammal. It is the only domesticated species in the family Felidae and is often referred to as the domestic cat to distinguish it from the wild members of the family.A cat can either be a house cat, a farm cat or a feral cat; the latter ranges freely and avoids human contact.Domestic cats are valued by humans for companionship and their ability to hunt rodents. About 60 cat breeds are recognized by various cat registries</p>
      <h2>Size</h2>
      <p>Cats average about 18 inches in head to body length and 9-10 inches in height, with about 12 inches long tails. Males are larger than females. Adult domestic cats typically weight berween 9 to 11 lb.</p>
      <h2>Vision</h2>
      <p>Cats have excellent night vision and can see at only one-sixth the light level required for human vision.</p>
      <h2>Hearing</h2>
      <p>The domestic cat's hearing is most acute in the range of 500 Hz to 32 kHz.[80] It can detect an extremely broad range of frequencies ranging from 55 Hz to 79,000 Hz. It can hear a range of 10.5 octaves, while humans and dogs can hear ranges of about 9 octaves.</p>
      <h2>Smell</h2>
      <p>Cats have an acute sense of smell, due in part to their well-developed olfactory bulb and a large surface of olfactory mucosa, about 5.8 square centimetres in area, which is about twice that of humans.</p>
      <h2>Taste</h2>
      <p>Cats have relatively few taste buds compared to humans (470 or so versus more than 9,000 on the human tongue).Domestic and wild cats share a taste receptor gene mutation that keeps their sweet taste buds from binding to sugary molecules, leaving them with no ability to taste sweetness.</p>
